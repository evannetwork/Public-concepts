# Negotiated Credential Exchange Protocol

## Summary
This document describes the Negotiated Credential Exchange Protocol, a two-party protocol for jointly conducting credential exchanges.

## Motivation
We want to introduce a standardized way for two parties to exchange credentials bidirectionally within different contexts.

It follows a description of a decentralized, lightweight, and customizable protocol enabling these two parties to jointly conduct this process.

## Roles
The Negotiated Credential Exchange Protocol uses two roles: the initiator and the receiver.

This protocol assumes that these two parties have already established an communication channel (e.g. via [DIDComm](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm)).  
The initiator is the party that initiates the credential exchange with a credential exchange proposal. They send a list of expected credentials, organized in contexts, to the receiver to arrange an agreement about the exchange process.  
The receiver is the party that receives such an initial credential exchange proposal and is expected to either agree to the proposed terms or make a counter-proposal.

## Tutorial
The Negotiated Credential Exchange Protocol has two distinct phases:
1. Negotation Phase
2. Exchange Phase

### Negotiation Phase
In this initial phase, the two parties negotiate various aspects about the credential exchange process:
- One or more **contexts** requested credentials are associated to
- The party **responsible** for providing the data for each context respectively
- List of **credentials** per context that the receiving party is expecting, each marked as either 'required' or 'optional'
- Additional **properties** associated with individual contexts
- Additional **properties** associated with the whole exchange

The protocol can be initiated by any of the two parties. The negotiation phase consists of at least one round of proposal and answer, with more rounds taking place if no immediate consensus about the details of the credential exchange can be found.

### Exchange Phase
In the exchange phase, the two parties proceed to share the credentials with the other party within the contexts they are responsible for, respectively. Contexts can either be updated sequentially or in parallel. The protocol does not take care of enforcing any particular order of sharing credentials, making the participants responsible for enforcing the correct order of the contexts being processed, if required. Sharing credentials within a context is done via context update messages. The receiving party can either accept the context update or reject it with a reason the other party can understand and act on.

#### Propose Credential Exchange
  - Initiator sends a credential exchange proposal to the receiver.
  - This includes DIDCOMM properties (message id and message type), required credentials for each context and the schema to use. Optionally, it may include any property to be associated with the exchange.
    - For example, the initiator can include proposed deadlines for the context.
  - For each credential a proof request is added. This proof request specifies the schema of the required credential and the attributes to reveal.
  - Sample: 
  ```JSONC
  {
    "@id": "<uuid>", // message ID
    "@type": "negotiated-credential-exchange/1.0/propose-credential-exchange",
    "propose-credential-exchange~attach": {
      "mime-type": "application/json",
      "data": {
        "properties": {
          "anyProperty": "anyValue"
        },
        "contexts": [
          {
            "name": "Environmental Certificates", // fetched from template
            "responsible": "<DID of receiver>",
            "properties": {
              "dueDate": "2020-01-01 00:00:00", // Optional
            },
            "credentials": [
              {
                "required": true,
                "proofRequest": {
                  "schema": "<DID of required VC schema>",
                  // Other proof request properties
                }
              }
            ]
          }
          // Other contexts...
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
#### Adjust Proposal
  - Sending an `adjust-proposal` message serves the purpose of suggesting changes to the proposed credential exchange
  - If the receiver deems the proposal unacceptable and does not want to change it, they can also send an error, exiting the protocol.
  - Sample:
  ```JSONC
  {
    "@id": "<uuid>",
    "~thread": {
      "thid": "<uuid of proposal-message>"
    },
    "@type": "negotiated-credential-exchange/1.0/adjust-proposal",
    "adjust-proposal~attach": {
      "mime-type": "application/json",
      "data": {
        "properties": {
          "anyProperty": "anyValue"
        },
        "contexts": [
          {
            "name": "Environmental Certificates",
            "responsible": "<DID of receiver>",
            "properties": {
              "dueDate": "2020-02-01 00:00:00", // Receiver wants to make adjustments here
            },
            "credentials": [
              {
                "required": true,
                "proofRequest": {
                  "schema": "<DID of required VC schema>",
                  // Other proof request properties
                }
              }
            ]
          }
          // Other contexts...
        ]
      }
    }    
  }
  ```

#### Complete Proposal
  - If the receiver is accepting the initiator's proposal, they send a `complete-proposal` message and complete the negotiation phase.
  - If the receiver decides to propose adjustements, the initiator receives an `adjust-proposal`. If they accept, they send a `complete-proposal` message to the receiver (including optional payload, like a VC).
  - If the initiator does not accept, they might send a new `propose-credential-exchange` message or send an error message and exit the protocol.
  - If each party both sent & received a `complete-proposal` message, the negotiation phase is done.
  ```JSONC
  {
    "@id": "<uuid>",
    "~thread": {
      "thid": "<uuid of proposal-message>"
    },
    "@type": "negotiated-credential-exchange/1.0/complete-proposal",
    "complete-proposal~attach": { // Optional
      "mime-type": "application/json",
      "data": {
        // Additional payload
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Updates
!["Context update"](./img/flowchart_context_update.svg "Context update")

#### Update context

- The party responsible for a context can update it by sending a `update-context` message, e.g. providing a required credential.
  ```JSONC
  {
    "@id": "<uuid>",
    "~thread": {
      "thid": "<uuid of proposal-message>"
    },
    "@type": "negotiated-credential-exchange/1.0/update-context",
    "update-context~attach": {
      "mime-type": "application/json",
      "data": {
        "contexts": [
          {
            "name": "Environmental Certificates",
            "properties": {
              "status": "complete"
            },
            "credentials": [
              {
                // Credential
                "schema": "<DID of required VC schema>",
                "proof": {
                  // ... 
                }                
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

#### Accept / Reject update
- The other party may accept this update.
  ```JSONC
  {
    "@id": "<uuid>",
    "~thread": {
      "thid": "<uuid of proposal-message>"
    },
    "@type": "negotiated-credential-exchange/1.0/accept-update",
  }
  ```

- Or initiator may request additional payload or criteria being met.
```JSONC
  {
    "@id": "<uuid>",
    "~thread": {
      "thid": "<uuid of proposal-message>"
    },
    "@type": "negotiated-credential-exchange/1.0/reject-update",
    "updateId": "<uuid of update-context message>",
    "reason": "Credential is revoked",
    "reject-update~attach":  {
      "mime-type": "application/json",
      "data": {
        // Further optional payload, e.g. explaining rejection
      }
    }
  }
```

- **NOTE**: Accepting a state update may also be conditional, e.g. when payment is expected. For this, [payment decorators](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0075-payment-decorators) may be used. 

## Example

In this short example, we imagine two parties, the fashion seller Francis and their supplier of textiles, Sam. Francis wants to order new shirts from Sam. Beforehand, Francis wants to receive a product sample, verify the quality and then order a batch of shirts. For the whole process, Francis wants to observe and track the status of their order. Therefore, the contexts in the protocol resemble the steps necessary to complete the order tracing process.
!["Order Tracing"](./img/order_tracing_tutorial.svg "Order Tracing")

### Negotiation Phase  

Sam sends an order tracing proposal to Francis. This proposal contains the contexts Sam needs to go through in order to complete Francis' order. Sam's message looks like the following:  

```JSONC

              }
            ]

                  "schema": "<DID of credential template verify-quality>"
                  // Other proof request properties
                }
              }
            ]
          },
          {

            "credentials": [
              {
                "required": true,

                  "schema": "<DID of credential template produce-batch>"
                  // Other proof request properties
                }
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "name": "Ship order",
            "properties": {
              "dueDate": "2020-04-05 17:00:00",

                  // Other proof request properties
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

Francis, however, does not agree on the due date of the final delivery and demands it to be less far in the future.

```JSONC

                  // Other proof request properties
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

Sam agrees to the modified terms.

```JSONC
  {
    "@id": "f38e9181-393e-40a0-b0ec-3a57b8f9ca42",
    "~thread": {
      "thid": "c4d61e49-73b0-4ff4-a76c-3cc2f0d28e69"
    },
    "@type": "negotiated-credential-exchange/1.0/complete-proposal",
  }
  ```

This marks the completion of the negotiation phase.

### Exchange phase

Sam notifies Francis as soon as they have sent the sample to Francis. As a proof Sam appends a shipment receipt.

```JSONC
  {
    "@id": "e0590c1d-da87-4ec8-bd55-928ac67cfcd8",
    "~thread": {
      "thid": "c4d61e49-73b0-4ff4-a76c-3cc2f0d28e69"
    },
    "@type": "negotiated-credential-exchange/1.0/update-context",
    "update-context~attach": {
      "mime-type": "application/json",
      "data": {
        "contexts": [
          {
            "contextName": "Send product sample",
            "properties": {
              "status": "complete"
            },
            "credentials": [
              {
                // Credential
                "schema": "<DID of credential template send-product-sample>",,
                "proof": {
                  // Shipment receipt
                }                
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

Francis accepts Sam's status update.

```JSONC
  {
    "@id": "325f92bf-620a-46cc-9ad6-6de5ea5fa46b",
    "~thread": {
      "thid": "c4d61e49-73b0-4ff4-a76c-3cc2f0d28e69"
    },
    "@type": "negotiated-credential-exchange/1.0/accept-update",
    "updateId": "e0590c1d-da87-4ec8-bd55-928ac67cfcd8",
  }
```

Next, Francis verifies the received sample's quality. Francis is satisfied and approves the verification context.

```JSONC
  {
    "@id": "a1524eca-9bf8-4133-825e-c3d0dc325d43",
    "~thread": {
      "thid": "c4d61e49-73b0-4ff4-a76c-3cc2f0d28e69"
    },
    "@type": "negotiated-credential-exchange/1.0/update-context",
    "update-context~attach": {
      "mime-type": "application/json",
      "data": {
        "contextName": "Verify quality",
        "properties": {
          "status": "complete"
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

Next, in the same manner Sam goes through the last two remaining steps and Francis approves Sam's step updates.
Once all steps have the status `complete`, the process is considered completed.


## Open Questions & To Dos
- Revisit negotiation phase and improve data exchange. It would probably be better to only send parts of the data
the proposal receiver does not agree with / wants to change instead of them sending back the whole proposal in an
altered form.
- Dictate proof [request] format or leave it open?
